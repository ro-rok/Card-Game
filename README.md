# Game of Strategy

It is a Python program for a client-server card game.

## Description

In this project, each player is assigned a specific suit of cards. The game is played over a series of rounds, where the server deals a card from the suit at random. Each client sends the server a card from their own deck. The server then compares the cards received from each client and awards the client with the highest value card with points equivalent to the value of the server's card. The game consists of 13 rounds, and a winner is determined based on the cumulative scores obtained over the course of these rounds.

## Getting Started

1. Install the 'tabulate' library using pip to view the scorecard at the end:
```
pip install tabulate
```
2. Run the server and client files separately.
3. Choose whether to play an automated or manual game for each client.
4. The game runs for 13 rounds, and the final scores are declared.
